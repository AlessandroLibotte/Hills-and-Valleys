# Hills-and-Valleys

Hello, I made this game all by my self with the only help of the tutorials you can find on javidx9's youtube channel:
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA .

All the coding took me about 5 days and when i started i knew nothing about game design but now i'm looking forward to make
other games really soon.

You are totally free to download the game and the source code and modify it as you like.


PS:
Sometime when you exec the game it starts a small window with a zero in it, in that case restart it until it works, i don't know what's causing the problem
